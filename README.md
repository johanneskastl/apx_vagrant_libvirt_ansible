# apx_vagrant_libvirt_ansible

This Vagrant setup creates a VM and installs the [apx package
manager](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx) on it.

Default OS is openSUSE Tumbleweed. Although that can be changed in the
Vagrantfile, please beware that this will break the Ansible provisioning.

## Vagrant

1. You need vagrant obviously. And ansible. And git...
1. Fetch the box, per default this is `opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`, using
   `vagrant box add opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`.
1. Make sure the git submodules are fully working by issuing `git submodule init
   && git submodule update`
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. Run `vagrant ssh` to log into the VM. Run `apx help` and start exploring the
   possibilities of `apx`
1. Party!

## Cleaning up

The VMs can be torn down after playing around using `vagrant destroy`.
